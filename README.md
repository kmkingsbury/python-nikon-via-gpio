A Nikon remote trigger has three wires: Blue, Green, Red.  
The Blue is a ground.  
Connecting Blue and Green cause the camera to focus  
Connection Blue and Red cause the shutter to fire and a picture to be taken.  
In order for the shutter to trigger the Blue and Green for focus must be connected as well.
